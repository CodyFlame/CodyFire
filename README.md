This is a kind of Alamofire with blackjack, roulette and craps!

This lib will convert your massive API code into an awesome convenient and easy maintainable calls in controllers!

Based on Alamofire 4.7.3.

Use Codable models for everything related to API requests:
- payload
- multipart payload
- response
- url query
- headers

Wondered? That's only little part of what you will get from this lib! üçª

## Quick examples

### How to send GET request

```swift
APIRequestWithoutPayload<ResultModel>("endpoint")
    .onSuccess { model in
    //here's your decoded model!
    //no need to check http.statusCode, I already did it for you! By default it's 200 OK
    //of course you can choose which statusCode is equal to success (look at the `POST` and `DELETE` examples below)
}
```

### How to send POST request

```swift
APIRequest<PayloadModel, ResultModel>("endpoint", payload: payloadModel)
    .method(.post)
    .desiredStatusCode(.created) //201 CREATED
    .onSuccess { model in
    //here's your decoded model!
    //success was determined by comparing desiredStatusCode with http.statusCode
}
```

### How to send DELETE request

```swift
APIRequestWithoutAnything("endpoint")
    .method(.delete)
    .desiredStatusCode(.noContent) //204 NO CONTENT
    .onSuccess { _ in
    //here's empty successful response!
    //success was determined by comparing desiredStatusCode with http.statusCode
}
```

Of course you'll be able to send PUT and PATCH requests, send multipart codable structs with upload progress callback, catch errors, even redefine error descriptions for every endpoint. Wondered? üòÉ Let's read the whole readme below! üçª

## How to install

CodyFire is available through [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org).

To install it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:
```ruby
pod 'CodyFire'
```

## How to setup

As CodyFire automatically detects which environment you're on and I suggest you to definitely use this awesome feature üëè

```swift
import CodyFire

@UIApplicationMain
class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {
    func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey : Any]? = nil) -> Bool {
        let dev = CodyFireEnvironment(baseURL: "http://localhost:8080")
        let testFlight = CodyFireEnvironment(baseURL: "https://stage.myapi.com")
        let appStore = CodyFireEnvironment(baseURL: "https://api.myapi.com")
        CodyFire.shared.configureEnvironments(dev: dev, testFlight: testFlight, appStore: appStore)
        //Also if you want to be able to switch environments manually just uncomment the line below (read more about that)
        //CodyFire.shared.setupEnvByProjectScheme()
        return true
    }
}
```

Isn't it cool? üòè

### Create your API controllers

I promise that this is API code architecture from your dreams which are come true!

#### Create an `API` folder and `API.swift` file inside it

```swift
import CodyFire

private let _APISharedInstance = API()

class API {
    public class var shared : API {
        return _APISharedInstance
    }

    let auth = AuthController()
    let task = TaskController()
}
```

#### Create a folder named `Controllers` inside `API` folder, and create a folder for each controller

`API/Controllers/Auth/Auth.swift`
```swift
class AuthController() {}
```
`API/Controllers/Task/Task.swift`
```swift
class TaskController() {}
```

#### Create an extension file for each controller's endpoint

##### Auth login as simple POST request

`API/Controllers/Auth/Auth+Login.swift`
```swift
import CodyFire

extension AuthController {
  struct LoginRequest: JSONPayload {
        let email, password: String
        init (email: String, password: String) {
            self.email = email
            self.password = password
        }
    }

    struct LoginResponse: Codable {
        var token: String
    }

    func login(_ request: LoginRequest) -> APIRequest<LoginRequest, LoginResponse> {
        return APIRequest("login", payload: request).method(.post)
            .addKnownError(.notFound, "User not found")
    }
}
```

##### Auth login for Basic auth

`API/Controllers/Auth/Auth+Login.swift`
```swift
import CodyFire

extension AuthController {
    struct LoginResponse: Codable {
        var token: String
    }

    func login(email: String, password: String) -> APIRequestWithoutPayload<LoginResponse> {
        return APIRequest("login").method(.post).basicAuth(email: email, password: password)
            .addKnownError(.notFound, "User not found")
    }
}
```

##### Task REST endpoints

###### Get task by id or a list of tasks by offset and limit

`API/Controllers/Task/Task+Get.swift`
```swift
import CodyFire

extension TaskController {
    struct Task: Codable {
        var id: UUID
        var name: String
    }

    struct ListQuery: Codable {
        var offset, limit: Int
        init (offset: Int, limit: Int) {
            self.offset = offset
            self.limit = limit
        }
    }

    func get(_ query: ListQuery? = nil) -> APIRequestWithoutPayload<[Task]> {
        return APIRequest("task").query(query)
    }

    func get(id: UUID) -> APIRequestWithoutPayload<Task> {
        return APIRequest("task/" + id.uuidString)
    }
}
```

###### Create a task

`API/Controllers/Task/Task+Create.swift`
```swift
import CodyFire

extension TaskController {
    struct CreateRequest: JSONPayload {
        var name: String
        init (name: String) {
            self.name = name
        }
    }

    func create(_ request: CreateRequest) -> APIRequest<CreateRequest, Task> {
        return APIRequest("post", payload: request).method(.post).desiredStatusCode(.created)
    }
}
```

###### Edit a task

`API/Controllers/Task/Task+Edit.swift`
```swift
import CodyFire

extension TaskController {
    struct EditRequest: JSONPayload {
        var name: String
        init (name: String) {
            self.name = name
        }
    }

    func create(id: UUID, request: EditRequest) -> APIRequest<EditRequest, Task> {
        return APIRequest("post/" + id.uuidString, payload: request).method(.patch)
    }
}
```

###### Delete a task

`API/Controllers/Task/Task+Delete.swift`
```swift
import CodyFire

extension TaskController {
    func delete(id: UUID) -> APIRequestWithoutAnything {
        return APIRequest("post/" + id.uuidString).method(.delete).desiredStatusCode(.noContent)
    }
}
```

### Easily use your API endpoints!

###### Send login request

```swift
API.shared.auth.login(email: "test@mail.com", password: "qwerty").onKnownError { error in
    switch error.code {
    case .notFound: print("User not found")
    default: print(error.description)
    }
}.onSuccess { token in
    print("Received auth token: "+ token)
}
```

###### Get a list of tasks

```swift
API.shared.task.get().onKnownError { error in
    print(error.description)
}.onSuccess { tasks in
    print("received \(tasks.count) tasks")
}
```

###### Create a task

```swift
API.shared.task.create(TaskController.CreateRequest(name: "Install CodyFire")).onKnownError { error in
    print(error.description)
}.onSuccess { task in
    print("just created new task: \(task)")
}
```

###### Delete a task

```swift
let taskId = UUID()
API.shared.task.delete(id: taskId).onKnownError { error in
    print(error.description)
}.onSuccess { _ in
    print("just removed task with id: \(taskId)")
}
```

### Multipart example

```swift
//declare a PostController
class PostController()
extension PostController {
    struct CreateRequest: MultipartPayload {
        var text: String
        var tags: [String]
        var images: [Attachment]
        var video: Data
        init (text: String, tags: [String], images: [Attachment], video: Data) {
            self.text = text
            self.tags = tags
            self.images = images
            self.video = video
        }
    }

    struct PostResponse: Codable {
        let id: UUID
        let text: String
        let tags: [String]
        let linksToImages: [String]
        let linkToVideo: String
    }

    func create(_ request: CreateRequest) -> APIRequest<CreateRequest, PostResponse> {
        return APIRequest("post", payload: request).method(.post)
    }
}

//then somewhere send creation request!

let videoData = FileManager.default.contents(atPath: "/path/to/video.mp4")!
let imageAttachment = Attachment(data: UIImage(named: "cat")!.jpeg(.high)!,
                                 fileName: "cat.jpg",
                                 mimeType: .jpg)
let payload = PostController.CreateRequest(text: "CodyFire is awesome",
                                           tags: ["codyfire", "awesome"],
                                           images: [imageAttachment],
                                           video: videoData)
API.shared.post.create(payload).onProgress { progress in
    print("tracking post uploading progress: \(progress)")
}.onKnownError { error in
    print(error.description)
}.onSuccess { createdPost in
    print("just created post: \(createdPost)")
}
```

Easy right? üéâ

## Details

#### How to put `Authorization Bearer` token into every request?
For that we have a global headers wrapper, which is called for every request.

You need to declare it e.g. somewhere in AppDelegate.

There are two options
1. Use Codable model for headers (recommended)
```swift
CodyFire.shared.fillCodableHeaders = {
    struct Headers: Codable {
        var Authorization: String? //NOTE: nil values will be excluded
        var anythingElse: String
    }
    return Headers(Authorization: nil, anythingElse: "hello")
}
```
2. Use [String: String] dictionary
```swift
CodyFire.shared.fillHeaders = {
    guard let apiToken = LocalAuthStorage.savedToken else { return [:] }
    return ["Authorization": "Bearer \(apiToken)"]
}
```

#### How to set a global `unauthorized` handler?
Again, somehere in AppDelegate declare it like this
CodyFire.shared.unauthorizedHandler = {
    //kick out user
}

#### Handle if network isn't available (e.g. wifi/lte turned off)
```swift
.onNetworkUnavailable {
    print("unfortunatelly there're no internet connection!")
}
```

#### Run something right before request started (works only if network is available)
```swift
.onRequestStarted {
    print("request started normally")
}
```

#### How to avoid log error for request
```siwft
.avoidLogError()
```

#### How to set desired status code and what's that means?
Usually servers response with `200 OK` and CodyFire expect to receive `200 OK` to call `onSuccess` handler by default.

You may need to specify another code, e.g. `201 CREATED` for some POST requests.
```swift
.desiredStatusCode(.created)
```
or you even can set your custom code
```swift
.desiredStatusCode(.custom(777))
```

#### How to set some headers for a request?

```swift
.headers(["myHeader":"myValue"])
//or for basic auth
.basicAuth(email: "", password: "")
```

#### What are supported HTTP methods?

You may use: GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, HEAD, TRACE, CONNECT, OPTIONS

#### How to switch environments through Xcode's run schemes?
It's really useful feature and I suggest to use it in every iOS project!

Create three schemes named: Development, TestFlight, AppStore like on the screenshot below
<img width="365" alt="2018-10-24 5 30 30" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1272610/47400378-f359c380-d74d-11e8-8d00-a325d06ed7bb.png">

TIP: Make sure that they're marked as `Shared` to have them in `git`

Then in every scheme in `Arguments` tab add `Environment variable` named `env` with one of those values: dev, testFlight, appStore.

Take a look at example below
<img width="895" alt="2018-10-24 5 34 43" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1272610/47400503-85fa6280-d74e-11e8-8846-3216b241dd6e.png">

Then somewhere in AppDelegate.didFinishLaunchingWithOptions add
```swift
CodyFire.shared.setupEnvByProjectScheme()
```
All done, now you're able to easily switch environments!

#### How to execute request without onSuccess clojure?
Sometimes useful for DELETE or PATCH requests
```swift
APIRequestWithoutAnything("endpoint").method(.delete).execute()
```

#### How to cancel request?
```swift
let request = APIRequest("").execute()
request.cancel()
```
and you're able to handle cancellation
```swift
.onCancellation {
    print("request was cancelled :(")
}
```

#### What does known error mean?

As you may see you're able to add `onError` block and also `onKnownError` block the difference between them that `onError` called only if `onKnownError` not set or if there're unknown error occured.

Let's take a look closer what we have in `onError` block
```swift
.onError { code in
    //there're only Int http error code like 404, 500, etc.
}
```
`onKnownError` is more powerful as it contains nice error description and http error code as enum
```swift
.onKnownError { error in
    switch error.code {
    case .notFound: print("It's not found :(")
    case .internalServerError: print("Oooops... Something really went wrong...")
    default: print("Another known erorr happened: " + error.description)
    }
}
```

More than that!!! In your controller while declaring APIRequest you're able to add your own known errors!!! üôÄ

```swift
APIRequest("login")
    .method(.post)
    .basicAuth(email: "sam@mail.com", password: "qwerty")
    .addKnownError(.notFound, "User not found")
```
I believe that's really awesome and useful! Finally a lot of things may be declared in one place! üéâ

#### How to set response timeout?
```swift
.responseTimeout(30) //request timeout set for 30 seconds
```
and of course you're able to catch timeout
```swift
.onTimeout {
    //timeout happened :(
}
```

#### How to add interactive additional timeout? (my favourite one üòÑ)
If you want to make sure that your request will take 2 or more seconds (to not be too fast üòÖ) you can do that
```swift
.additionalTimeout(2)
```
e.g. in case if your request will be executed in 0.5 seconds, `onSuccess` handler will be fired only in 1.5s after that
but in case if your request will take more than 2s then `onSuccess` handler will be fired immediatelly

#### How to declare payload model for multipart request
Your struct/class just should conform to `MultipartPayload` protocol
```swift
struct SomePayload: MultipartPayload {
    let name: String
    let names: [String]
    let date: Date
    let dates: [Dates]
    let number: Double
    let numbers: [Int]
    let attachment: Data
    let attachments: [Data]
    let fileAttachment: Attachment
    let fileAttachments: [Attachment]
}
```

#### How to declare payload model for json request
Your struct/class just should conform to `JSONPayload` protocol
```swift
struct SomePayload: JSONPayload {
    let name: String
    let names: [String]
    let date: Date
    let dates: [Dates]
    let number: Double
    let numbers: [Int]
}
```

#### How to declare url query params model
Your struct/class just should conform to `Codable` protocol
```swift
struct SomePayload: Codable {
    let name: String
    let names: [String]
    let date: Date
    let dates: [Dates]
    let number: Double
    let numbers: [Int]
}
```

#### How to set date decoding/encoding strategy
Our `DateCodingStrategy` support
 - secondsSince1970
 - millisecondsSince1970
 - formatted(customDateFormatter: DateFormatter)
By default all the dates are in `yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss'Z'` format

You have interesting options here:
 - you can set global date decoder/encoder
 ```swift
 CodyFire.shared.dateEncodingStrategy = .secondsSince1970
 let customDateFormatter = DateFormatter()
 CodyFire.shared.dateDecodingStrategy = .formatted(customDateFormatter)
 ```
 - you can set date decoder/encoder for request in your controller
 ```swift
 APIRequest().dateDecodingStrategy(.millisecondsSince1970).dateEncodingStrategy(.secondsSince1970)
 ```
 - or you even can use different date encoder/decoder for each payload type (highest priority)
 ```swift
 struct SomePayload: JSONPayload, CustomDateEncodingStrategy, CustomDateDecodingStrategy {
    var dateEncodingStrategy: DateCodingStrategy
    var dateDecodingStrategy: DateCodingStrategy
 }
 ```

#### How to enable/disable logging
e.g. in AppDelegate you may set logging mode
```swift
CodyFire.shared.logLevel = .debug
CodyFire.shared.logLevel = .error
CodyFire.shared.logLevel = .info
CodyFire.shared.logLevel = .off
```
and also you can set log handler
```swift
CodyFire.shared.logHandler = { level, text in
    print("manually printing codyfire error: " + text)
}
```
by default for the AppStore the log level if `.off`

#### How you're detecting current environment?
It's easy

```swift
#if DEBUG
//DEV environment
#else
if Bundle.main.appStoreReceiptURL?.lastPathComponent == "sandboxReceipt" {
//TESTFLIGHT environment
} else {
//APPSTORE environment
}
#endif
```
